This project uses the Jasmine testing framework.

How to use:
Open the index.html file using your favorite browser.
You will see the application on your browser and you will find the Jasmine section at the bottom of the page.

To view the jamine code I wrote, open feedreader.js under jasmine/spec/ folder.
